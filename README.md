# marrow-lang

Marrow is a performant interpreted/compiled language project in early development. The current focus is on tokenization and numeric utilities, with parsing/AST and execution still in progress.

## Build
- `make`

## Run
- `./marrow-lang path/to/file`

## Status
- Tokenizer is functional and prints token streams.
- Number subsystem supports arbitrary-precision decimal digits with basic arithmetic.
- Parser/AST, bytecode emission, and VM execution are not implemented yet.

## Next Steps
See `TODO.md` for the current task list pulled from in-code TODOs.
